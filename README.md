## Andres Faraone-Pirie
I’m a full stack junior developer and recent Makers Academy graduate. As a teacher and a language learner, I love learning new things and helping others do the same. I’m looking for a job where I can grow as a developer, gain hands-on experience and contribute to the team.

## Skills

#### Great Communicator
 - Teaching
 
 As a teacher, I had to be engaging and communicate well in large groups. I excelled at breaking down concepts and presenting them in a clear fashion.

 - Startup Company

I was employed as an inhouse language consultant for a startup company that was working on a chatbot system. I had to communicate with developers frequently and explain issues regarding linguistics.

#### Quick Learner
 - Makers Academy
 
 I had already studied some programming in my spare time in the past. At Makers I took on the challenge of a fast-paced learning environment. Not only did I learn Ruby and JS, I become comfortable with using web frameworks, CI/CD and HTTP requests.

- Living and working in China
 
I learned enough Mandarin to study abroad after a year of study. I adapted to the challenge of living abroad, and attending classes taught solely in Mandarin.

#### Analytical Skills
 - Masters in Linguistics
 
I have a strong methodical approach to problems. This is demonstrated by my academic background, which required logical reasoning and academic rigour. Im my Masters, I further developed my analytical skills by applying statistical methods to my research.


#### Organized

 - As a teacher I designed courses in Academic English and Linguistics. This required organisation, working with colleagues and being methodical.
 
 - I followed Agile principes throughout whilst working on group projects at Makers.
